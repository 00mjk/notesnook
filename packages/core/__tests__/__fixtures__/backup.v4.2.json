Complicated organisation"},{"attributes":{"header":2},"insert":"\n"},{"insert":"Ever wondered why it is so much preferred to take notes in an actual notebook than on a digital app? Why do you see all the journalists and students scribbling away at their notepads? \nEase of access. Notebooks are so simple that the only thing you have to do is open them and start writing.\nNotesnook tries to follow this same philosophy. Organization should be so easy that you can remember where you put everything. \nA lot of note taking apps address this problem the wrong way. They add in hierarchies, tables, boxes, and God knows what. The end result is that the user is baffled when he is wants to organize his notes. Where should he put it? Should he color this? Should he tag this? Should this be on first level or second level? Which box should this belong too? So many questions.\nThe learning curve is so steep that most users end up abandoning digital note taking for good. \nNotesnook is different. It won't make you ask so many questions. Organization is simple and one way. Either the note belongs to a notebook or it doesn't. Either you color it or you tag it. It's amazing how easy note Organization gets like this. \nImagine that you are an author and you want to write a new book. In Notesnook, taking book notes is extremely easy. You create a notebook, you add 1 topic for each chapter then you keep notes related to that chapter in that topic. Simple, efficient, organised. What about cross linking? What if you want to reference a note from one topic into another? "},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"That's also simple, a note can exist in multiple topics.
