I also find Evernote’s sync to be much faster and more reliable.\nPersonal Opinion\nI hate OneNote interface. It's too busy, and too rigid. I love that things are hidden in Evernote until I ask for them. \nimport export\nCuriously, I've seen Apple Notes import/update about 1000 notes in just a few seconds, whereas OneNote took, I'm thinking, manual intervention, and \"massaging\" the app to make it do what it should've done automatically took a few hours. That was amazing in the first place and aggravating as hell in the second.\nNo Annotaions(1)\nSorting notes problem:\nI'm so frustrated that OneNote can't sort pages. \nexport data problem:\nIt's all but impossible to move data out of ON UWP if you have any attachments\nslow, when scrolling,\nNavigation,searching,tagging difficult\nWeb clipper isn't so great.\nApp stopped Working(1(62)+)\nDifference in IOS and Android vesion(1(47)+1+1+1):\nThe Android version of this app lacks many basic features (like the ability to reorder your notebooks) which other versions of the app have (such as the iOS's). It seems that it has been this way for years and there's no indication that Microsoft is ever going to give this version of the app these features. \nData loss(2):\nApp becomes buggy after few months use. Deleting the app deletes the data. Which is horrible as the data gets lost.  \nPdf not completely share(1(265))\nSudden bugs which make the app useless:\nCan't save to SD card -(1(66))\nMobile UI not good\nLatest update causes it to crash \n\n","conflicted":false,"resolved":false,"dateEdited":1602664916556,"dateCreated":1602569869142},"4eefc5f0a31106a8200d9b25":{"id":"4eefc5f0a31106a8200d9b25","deleted":true,"dateCreated":1604570062258,"dateEdited":1604570062258},"5a990d8756711f5000ca7bb0":{"noteId":"8cdd40202e9ad46d2284e899","id":"5a990d8756711f5000ca7bb0","data":{"noteId":"8cdd40202e9ad46d2284e899","id":0,"data":""},"conflicted":false,"resolved":false,"dateEdited":1602569940972,"dateCreated":1602569940972},"5b8be6c431ccaa72e124dd02":{"id":"5b8be6c431ccaa72e124dd02","type":"note","title":"Bear","content":{"text":"8383b0aabcecce55086cf6c3","delta":"41e5b3708e8249cd8b462ef6"},"pinned":false,"locked":false,"notebook":{},"colors":[],"tags":[],"favorite":false,"headline":"","dateCreated":1602569909033,"conflicted":false,"dateEdited":1602569909033},"5dfaf89ee7fceeb00b84d4f3":{"noteId":"ccd880517ad79018f2564bd9","id":"5dfaf89ee7fceeb00b84d4f3","data":{"ops":[{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Small insignificant but useful features behind subscription (for e.g. Darkmode,"},{"attributes":{"color":"#333333"},"insert":" "},{"attributes":{"color":"#333333","bold":true},"insert":"undo"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":")"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"bold":true},"insert":"Lame search features:"},{"insert":"\n"},{"attributes":{"color":"#333333"},"insert":" it won't suggest it when you start typing #uni, you have to fully type it each time and you better not make a typo.

If your document has a number of bullet points, pasting it onto EN results in all your bullet points in different margins and a scrambled order.\nDrawing\nDrawing: is limited and awkward.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Evernote/comments/9nrxq8/deciding_between_evernote_and_onenote/\nSolid Review\nMy biggest gripes with Evernote were the lack of encryption, poor tools for working with file attachments, and the fact that the service lately seems to be milking its existing users while trying to reinvent itself as a business tool... while not providing these existing users with any notable improvements. I don’t mind paying $70 /year or whatever they are charging now but not for the service that stayed unchanged for years with no content encryption, same old bugs, and the propensity to every now and then lose something.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Evernote/comments/8m4lo3/so_hows_evernote/\nNo real hierarchy\nthe lack of nested notebooks is insanely maddening.\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Evernote/comments/az99zj/meet_x_the_evernote_killer/\nApp Hangs+Log in Errors & Bugs(2+1+1+1(46)+1(146)+1(188)+1(77)+1(98)+1(68))\nThe app always hangs immediately when I tried to edit or search in a note. It has the same problem on my new Samsung S20 FE 5G. It is useless on android phones!! I hope I can find a way to export my note to another app.\nSafety and Security issues (3) +1+1+1(72)\nYour data is not safe! Never again.There were too many bugs and malfunctions in the last two years. It lock my own notes from me just because my subscription was ended. I continued to use the app just because I was lazy to search to an alternative. But last couple of moths were disaster! Multiple people from various countries entered my account. EVERNOTE DID NOT NOTIFY ME until I tried to enter my account and notice other accouts! Besides, you cant download notes! It is 2020 :O\n\nSERIOUS SECURITY ISSUE. This app is now asking for permission 'Prevent phone from sleeping'. It seems simple BUT when it prevents phone from sleeping, 1) the automatic lock function does NOT work (because, in many handsets the autolock setting is like 'x' seconds after sleep). 2) it drains battery. FIX IT SOON. REMOVE THAT PERMISSION ASAP.\nAds Issue:(128 thumbs up) +1+1Playstore\nUsed to be a great app, now I get full screen \"40% off premium\" ads every day or two. When I click \"cancel\" or whatever the app says \"You won't get this offer again\" then two days later it pops up again. Best part is that we're looking for an app like this at work and we have budget to pay for premium, but if these jokers are going to force full screen ads on my personal device they won't be getting our business for premium\nNot user friendly\nIncomplete features on android Side vs IOS\nRelated to Subscription:\nYou need a subscription to store and access your own notes on your own phone. Disgusting business model. I'd pay a one-time price for the app just to write and keep notes locally on my phone. The app's writing tools were exactly what I was looking for, but requiring a subscription to have offline notes is absurd and backwards, when so many other businesses charge for their cloud services, instead. It even has shameless push notifications to remind you of its existence; a note-taking app.\nInconsistency\n\"Signing out will remove all your cached notes and offline notebooks from your device. Do you want to sign out?\" But, on Google, it says otherwise. On Google, it says if you deactivate/sign out (of)/delete your account, your cached notes/offline notebooks won't be removed and will instead be saved. Do you have something to say, Evernote? Or do you want to continue lying to your audience?\nSave web articles:\nI downloaded this app specifically for the ability to save articles from the web. However, this functionality is not working. I've tried with many different articles from many different websites, so it's definitely the app. I am also using an updated version of Chrome.\nSubscription Cancellation difficult:(63 thumbs up)\nThey're clearly just trying to take your money. I signed up for the free trial just to be able to use it to see if I liked it, which required entering your credit card info. I didn't like it. I don't feel it serves my needs. So now it's sending me on a wild goose chase to cancel my subscription before it charges me $70 in 10 days. There's no way to cancel your subscription directly through the app. Can't do it online, either. So now, I'm trying it through the Google store. Highway robbers.\nData Loss(234 thumbs up):\nEvernote used to be wonderful. Somewhere around June of 2020 or may of 2020. Something happened all of my poetry that I had stored on Evernote is gone. These are my words I could never ever replace. I am heartbroken.
