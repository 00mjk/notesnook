More long than a usual note that a person will write and it seems to working fine. \n"}],"conflicted":false,"resolved":false,"dateEdited":1607533478034,"dateCreated":1607461508740},"22b7d693db3b9c0d0e8e0b35":{"id":"22b7d693db3b9c0d0e8e0b35","contentId":"83bb81af39c3c069dfba265e","type":"note","title":"New Poem","headline":"If we must turn to dust, As our bodies wane and go, I wonder then, what remains ","pinned":false,"locked":false,"tags":[],"favorite":false,"dateCreated":1607502539810,"conflicted":false,"dateEdited":1607517193199},"content":["6f0199dc49c296c215f7b9c6","c163821c6c826185eecfb459","8cdaa4c1900ad5fa0ef22cda","42300405fe83dd985d10f516","b4f3330c3738acf08a9afa3d","0a5b88d6ee2cc49d9d77361f","83bb81af39c3c069dfba265e"],"theme":{"night":false},"31020dcdaacb7030cbe68a74":{"id":"31020dcdaacb7030cbe68a74","contentId":"c163821c6c826185eecfb459","type":"note","title":"Hey","headline":"World ","pinned":false,"locked":false,"tags":[],"favorite":false,"dateCreated":1607414789753,"conflicted":false,"dateEdited":1607461413062,"migrated":true,"color":"red"},"e4aec5bab89c86491c98c7d9":{"type":"tag","id":"e4aec5bab89c86491c98c7d9","title":"red","noteIds":["31020dcdaacb7030cbe68a74"],"deletedIds":[],"dateCreated":1607461413059,"dateEdited":1607461413059},"accentColor":"#0560FF","37a84ee628af3d7fac220715":{"id":"37a84ee628af3d7fac220715","deleted":true,"dateCreated":1607461413056,"dateEdited":1607461413056},"0c4bc3a513d38d5b6c292824":{"id":"0c4bc3a513d38d5b6c292824","deleted":true,"dateCreated":1607461411182,"dateEdited":1607461411182},"settings":{"type":"settings","id":"120fbd52014c61314f6d6a77","pins":[],"dateEdited":0,"dateCreated":1607345919306},"b4f3330c3738acf08a9afa3d":{"noteId":"50c36b38b0140d1b95de5fc1","id":"b4f3330c3738acf08a9afa3d","type":"delta","data":[{"insert":"The wind has not settled,\nFrom a window that is open,\nIt gushes through the hallways,\nAnd reaches where I sit,\nAs if it has come to me,\nTo creep in and touch my skin,\nOr maybe just go around my feet,\nOr dance between fingers that freeze,\nUhh! uncomfortably I look up and frown,\nand go about every room, \npeeking behind every curtain,\nTo see which window I forgot to close,\nAnd it is not only the cold,\nBut it goes on leaving its marks,\nIt leaves no one and nothing and settles,\nOn any surface that it can find,\nMaking all the mess but still,\nI have to give it some passage,\nAs it helps me breathe.\n\n"}],"conflicted":false,"resolved":false,"dateEdited":1607460888679,"dateCreated":1607458830924},"appSettings":{"showToolbarOnTop":false,"showKeyboardOnOpen":false,"fontScale":1,"forcePortraitOnTablet":false,"useSystemTheme":false,"reminder":"off","encryptedBackups":false,"homepage":"Notes","sort":"default","sortOrder":"des","screenshotMode":true,"privacyScreen":false},"colors":["0c4bc3a513d38d5b6c292824","37a84ee628af3d7fac220715","e4aec5bab89c86491c98c7d9"],"notes":["5be88edca25346e9302986a5","31020dcdaacb7030cbe68a74","c9109756d4a52301020b3983","c1a7f7cbf87e2b8285184df5","50c36b38b0140d1b95de5fc1","c97692a41bf7d235b1c1180b","22b7d693db3b9c0d0e8e0b35"],"c1a7f7cbf87e2b8285184df5":{"id":"c1a7f7cbf87e2b8285184df5","contentId":"42300405fe83dd985d10f516","type":"note","title":"A poem","headline":"She is a blue bird on a tree, Where I lay under its shade, And see the sunlight ","pinned":false,"locked":false,"tags":[],"favorite":false,"dateCreated":1607447811959,"conflicted":false,"dateEdited":1607451608989},"8cdaa4c1900ad5fa0ef22cda":{"noteId":"c9109756d4a52301020b3983","id":"8cdaa4c1900ad5fa0ef22cda","type":"delta","data":[{"insert":"Hey worlds ss d\n"}],"conflicted":false,"resolved":false,"dateEdited":1607423220830,"dateCreated":1607414957061},"v":4.3,"5be88edca25346e9302986a5":{"id":"5be88edca25346e9302986a5","contentId":"6f0199dc49c296c215f7b9c6","type":"note","title":"Abcde","headline":"Safe worldss ","pinned":false,"locked":false,"tags":[],"favorite":false,"dateCreated":1607379617921,"conflicted":false,"dateEdited":1607423220821,"migrated":true},"c163821c6c826185eecfb459":{"noteId":"31020dcdaacb7030cbe68a74","id":"c163821c6c826185eecfb459","type":"delta","data":[{"insert":"World\n"}],"conflicted":false,"resolved":false,"dateEdited":1607423220828,"dateCreated":1607414789744},"c97692a41bf7d235b1c1180b":{"id":"c97692a41bf7d235b1c1180b","contentId":"0a5b88d6ee2cc49d9d77361f","type":"note","title":"Long Note","headline":"I have to keep writing to say all the things that I want to say.
